# Java Programming Test

Please write, in Java, an API to read the contents of a plain text file and enable the display of the
total number of words, the average word length, the most frequently occurring word length, and a
list of the number of words of each length.

Submit your code, along with unit tests, and maven POM file, in a zip file or Github repository, via
email along with instructions for its installation and use, along with any assumptions that you have
made about what defines a word (using as a basis the rules that can be deduced from the example
below).

For example given a file that contains the following text:
```
Hello world & good morning. The date is 18/05/2016
```
We would expect the following output:
```
Word count = 9
Average word length = 4.556
Number of words of length 1 is 1
Number of words of length 2 is 1
Number of words of length 3 is 1
Number of words of length 4 is 2
Number of words of length 5 is 2
Number of words of length 7 is 1
Number of words of length 10 is 1
The most frequently occurring word length is 2, for word lengths of 4 & 5
```
Note that we will test code submissions on a number of files of various lengths ranging from the
above example through to the large books such as the Bible:

```
Clue â€“ Do not forget to consider formatted numbers.
On the code test:
* This is as much about reading and understanding the problem statement as it is about coding.
* We are looking for eloquent, efficient, machine efficient code.
* Use advanced coding features to help with the above.
* The corollary of the above - do not over complicate the solution.
* Make sure the completed version works!
